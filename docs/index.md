## PART 2: Cloud Skills Challenge (CSC)
  ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/images/learn_left_icon.png)
  - To deepen your skills after the sessions, we run a one month Cloud Skills Challenge, where you compete with your colleagues for for climbing the leaderboard.
  - This is a gamified, hands-on self-learning challenge
  - The challenge is running from **July 15th 09:00 CET** to **August 15th 23:59:59 CET**
  - Everything is happening on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/) , our global technical learning platform. For some labs, there will be sandboxes to run the code, directly from your browser (*)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Please use your **private/personal** workstation, or an "open" developer desktop where you have admin rights to install CLIs, tools libraries locally, pull dependiencies from the internet (via ``mvm install`` etc.) and a normal browser with JavaScript and Cookies enabled etc.
  - Currently, using Microsoft Learn is probably not accessible from your coporate workstations due to tight browser/security restrictions. We're working on streamlining this experience for future events, but data security and compliance are of course non-negotiatable. 
  - You'll also need your personal **Microsoft ID** (and potentially your github.com login)
  
  
Please register and login here:

### Data privacy and PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
  ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/images/learn_right_icon.png)


**NOTE**: Microsoft runs on trust, and data privacy and compliance are key aspects of that. 
Our global Microsoft Learn platform is **never** sharing your PII with other Microsoft teams (like marketing) or individuals without your explicit consent. In our context here this also means that we have no way of reaching out to the challenge participants directly, e.g. by just downloading the leaderboard or exporting the participant list. 

Please get in touch with the event organisers instead afterwards on how to claim your winner rewards. We'll make sure we find a compliant way to pass your rewards to you.
