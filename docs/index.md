### Your reward: Azure Hero "Learner" Digital NFT
For joining our sessions, you will be eligible for a digitial badge.

[Azure Heroes](https://www.microsoft.com/skills/azureheroes) is a digital collectibles program for inclusive behaviour and meaningful impact to our technical community.

By joining our tech sessions, you are eligible to claim a **Azure Hero "Learner"** Badge into your wallet. Check out the website to find out about the other collectibles and how to earn them!




NOTE: Azure Hero "Badgers" are **NFT**s ("Nun-Fungible Tokens", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), stored on the Ethereum Blockchain and claimed into your personall wallet. 
By using the blockchain, those are verifiably scarse resources and you can also "proof" your individual achievement this way.

## PART 2: Cloud Skills Challenge (CSC)
  ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/images/learn_left_icon.png)
  - To deepen your skills after the sessions, we run a one month Cloud Skills Challenge, where you compete with your colleagues on XP points on a global leaderboard.
  
  - This is a gamified, "friendly compete" hands-on self-learning challenge, starting running from **July 15th 09:00 CET** to **August 15th 23:59:59 CET**
  - Everything is happening on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/) , our global technical learning platform. For some labs, there will be sandboxes to run the code, directly from your browser (*)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Please use your **private/personal** workstation, or an "open" developer desktop where you have admin rights to install CLIs, tools libraries locally, pull dependiencies from the internet (via ``mvm install`` etc.).
  - Currently, using Microsoft Learn is probably not accessible from your coporate workstations due to tight browser/security restrictions. We're working on streamlining this experience for future events, but data security and compliance are of course non-negotiatable. 
  - You'll also need your personal **Microsoft ID** (and potentially your github.com login)

### A note on data privacy and PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
  ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/images/learn_right_icon.png)


**NOTE**: Microsoft runs on trust, and data privacy is key. 
Microsoft Learn is **never** sharing your PII with other Microsoft teams (like marketing) or individuals without your explicit consent. This also means that we have no way of reaching out to challenge participants directly, e.g. by just looking at the leaderboard.
Please get in touch with the event organisers afterwards if you think you qualify as a winner, and we'll make sure we find a compliant way to sent you the goodies.
