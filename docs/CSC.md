# How to join the Cloud Skills Challenge

Cloud Skills Challenges are timeboxed, self-learning opportunities
along technical learning content we selected for you. 
It's all done on Microsoft Learn https://learn.microsoft.com/.

You'll need to login with your Microsoft ID in order to participate and track your progress.
Some hands-on tutorials will launch a Sandbox directly in your browser. If you encourage problems with that, let us know, and we might find an alternative way for you to try things out.
